## Project set up
I think these are fairly standard but it is always better to have a nice guide on what is intended to get the project running


### Pull the repo
``` git clone damianpokorski/vendingmachine```

You can either just call the PHPUnit binary directly
```vendor/bin/phpunit```
Or use the executable task within the composer.json
